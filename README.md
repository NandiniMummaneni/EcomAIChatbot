ðŸ¤– AI-Ready Chatbot Platform (Project Name Suggestion: ShopAssist MVP)
A responsive, full-stack application featuring a lightweight, custom-built chatbot currently deployed on an Angular frontend. This project demonstrates core Full Stack proficiency, clean API design, and a clear pathway for advanced AI integration, leveraging a modern Python/ML architecture.

ðŸŒŸ Key Features (Current MVP - Showcasing Core Competency)
Full-Stack Architecture: Client-side built using Angular and TypeScript for a dynamic, interactive UI.

Rule-Based Backend: Utilizes a custom, highly optimized, minimal-dependency Python engine for immediate, low-latency pattern matching.

Minimal Latency: Achieves ultra-fast response times through simple pattern matching, proving capability in performance-focused API design.

API Foundation: Designed with a scalable REST API to easily interchange the current rule-based engine with future complex AI models.

ðŸ“ˆ AI/ML Roadmap & Future Scope (Highlighting AI Expertise)
The core purpose of this project is to serve as a production-ready base for implementing advanced AI/ML features. Future updates will strategically leverage specialized skills, including:

Natural Language Understanding (NLU): Transitioning from rule-based to context-aware NLP using Python with libraries like Hugging Face Transformers for sentiment and intent analysis.

LLM Integration: Integrating an LLM-powered agent (e.g., via LangChain or direct GPT API) to provide deep, context-aware shopping recommendations and multi-turn conversational support.

MLOps Deployment: Utilizing Azure for scalable cloud deployment and implementing robust MLOps workflows for model versioning, continuous training, and monitoring of predictive analytics models.

Predictive Analytics: Developing a deep learning model to predict customer purchasing behavior based on chat history and browsing patterns.
